# force-directed-graph-godot
is a simple implementation of a [Force-Directed Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) (or FDG for short) in the Godot Engine.


## What is a Force-Directed Graph?
> Force-directed graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically-pleasing way. (Wikipedia)

The graph is a physical simulation of a system of bodies (nodes) connected by springs (edges). The system is simulated by applying forces to the nodes and springs and then updating their positions.

`force-directed-graph-godot` uses an implementation of the method showcased in [this incredible lecture by David Dobervich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTBuq0CXpWs).


## Usage
1. Add a `ForceDirectedGraph` node to your scene.
2. Add `FDGNode` nodes as children of the `ForceDirectedGraph` node.
3. Add `FDGSpring` nodes as children of the `ForceDirectedGraph` node.
4. Connect the `FDGNode` nodes with `FDGSpring` nodes by setting the `node_start` and `node_end` properties of the `FDGSpring` nodes.

### Nodes
- **ForceDirectedGraph**
- **FDGNode**
- **FDGSpring**
